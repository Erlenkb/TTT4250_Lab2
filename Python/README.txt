The Imp_tube.py file is the one containing the code done for lab2 in TTT4250. 
Possible errors are related to the R&H value that branches into the the alpha and Z value. Not sure what values that are expected
But cant help to think this is not right. 

The first error are related to R not following the |R| \leq 1, which further affect \alpha and Z.

Did the pseudo code in matlab and compared the results. 2 zip files are included showing results from both python and matlab
